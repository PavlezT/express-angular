<p><strong>Welcome to AposTherapy&reg;!</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for being here today to begin the AposTherapy&reg; treatment program.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s introductory assessment we will need your help to understand as much as we can about your condition. The more precisely we understand your condition, the better we can optimize your treatment for you. That is why you will be requested to complete some questionnaires, a gait (walking) analysis and a personal interview with an AposTherapy&reg; trained clinician.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>

<p><strong>Medical questionnaires</strong></p>

<p>First, you will be presented with a few computerized questionnaires on this tablet. The questionnaire will ask about the level of pain you are experiencing and its impact on your ability to go about your daily activities.</p>

<p><strong>Gait (walking) measurement</strong></p>

<p>During the gait assessment you will be asked to walk up and down a special track that takes computerized measurements of your steps: such as walking velocity, step length and load distribution on each leg.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting with your AposTherapy&reg; trained clinician</strong></p>

<p>In your one-on-one session, your AposTherapy&reg; trained clinician will ask you questions about your medical history and your current condition. Also, they will conduct a physical examination to check things such as your range of motion and any swelling or tenderness that you might be experiencing.</p>

<p><strong>Fitting for your AposTherapy&reg; device</strong></p>

<p>Based on your assessment today, your AposTherapy&reg; trained clinician will assemble and calibrate an AposTherapy&reg; device according to your specific needs. Then, they will observe as you walk in the device for the first time. They will then adjust the settings of the device to optimize it for your benefit and comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Planning your AposTherapy&reg; program</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the process, your AposTherapy&reg; trained clinician will provide you with a written, detailed plan and advise you on how to use the AposTherapy&reg; device in the coming weeks. They will also discuss the next steps for your treatment and what to expect in the near future. You will also be scheduled for a follow up appointment.</p>

<p><em>Achieving success with AposTherapy&reg; is accomplished through regular use of your AposTherapy&reg; device. This is easy to do because the treatment takes place as you go about your daily activities. Your visit at the clinic today is the first step to setting that recovery in motion.</em></p>

<p>Wishing you a healthy, speedy return to pain-free full function!</p>
